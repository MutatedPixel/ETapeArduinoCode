# EtapeArduinoCode
Some code to read the resistance and inches of an etape sensor on an arduino.
This code is very flexible. It can (in theory, I haven't tried it) work with any
size ETape and it can be calibrated for use with your specific ETape device.
Simply fill out the different values for various components and change some code
for different sizes and you should be good to go.

All the current values are for a 12 inch model using a 560 ohm resistor.
